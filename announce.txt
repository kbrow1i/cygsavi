Subject: savi 1.5.1-1

The following package has been added to the Cygwin distribution:

* savi-1.5.1-1

SaVi allows you to simulate satellite orbits and coverage, in two and
three dimensions.  SaVi is particularly useful for simulating
satellite constellations.  SaVi can use Geomview, an optional package,
for 3D rendering.
